# Word Memory

This is a simple, web-based memory game to help my daughter practice her sight words. When she was doing preschool at home during the pandemic lockdown, they had her play a word-matching game that she really liked, so I thought I would try to make one for her myself. It was also a chance to try out XState.

I wanted each set of words to be easily bookmarkable, so the configuration can all be done in the URL query params.

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for rendering the UI.
- [XState](https://xstate.js.org) for managing the state of the game.
- [Feather](https://feathericons.com/) for the icons.

## Running locally

This project was bootstrapped by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev), so all the [scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts) available on there are also here.

To run this project locally, enter these commands from inside the project root:

```
npm install
npm start
```

You can then see the app at http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
